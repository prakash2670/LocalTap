# 🖥️ LocalTap

**LocalTap** is a cross-platform desktop application that tracks **keyboard** and **mouse input activity** — clicks, scrolls, and key presses — with a privacy-first approach. Built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), it logs daily usage data locally and provides a responsive dashboard with real-time stats and charts.
